# Document Based AI Chatbot

This project implements a Document-Based AI Chatbot that allows users to query multiple documents using natural language. It features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for improved query responses, integrated with a FAISS vector store for fast document retrieval and FastAPI for backend services.

The chatbot can handle document uploads, build a FAISS index, and generate responses based on the uploaded documents. Additionally, it integrates Ollama's LLaMA 3.2 model for generating AI-driven answers to user queries.

## Key Features

- **Document Upload and Indexing:** Users can upload documents, which are processed and indexed using FAISS for efficient retrieval.

- **Query Engine:** Allows users to ask questions, and it returns relevant answers based on the uploaded documents.

- **FastAPI Backend:** Built using FastAPI for fast and efficient API endpoints.

- **FAISS Vector Store:** Provides high-speed document search and retrieval using a vector-based indexing system.

- **Ollama Integration:** Utilizes the LLaMA3.2 model to generate concise, context-aware responses.
